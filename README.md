# ZxcGram for Android

## What's this fork even about?

**Is it just exteraGram+Telegraher?**

**ZxcGram** is a fork of [AyuGram]([https://github.com/exteraSquad/exteraGram](https://github.com/AyuGram)) with
some patches from [Telegraher](https://github.com/nikitasius/Telegraher).

But it's not just exteraGram with Telegraher's commits, **it's a fully reworked version**.

The main difference between ZxcGram and Telegraher is that ZxcGram **saves** your messages history,
while Telegraher just **caches** them.
It means that you can clean your cache and still have all saved messages.

Also, ZxcGram has **full ghost mode**.
It allows you to hide your online status from other users, even if you send them
a message.

*And, well, it's not an Iranian Telegram fork with floating TV or something.*

## Features list

### Telegraher's patches:

- Built with official keys
- Screenshots in secret chats
- No emulator detection
- No ads

### Reworked Telegraher's patches:

- Save chats where you were banned/kicked
- Expire button for TTL photos/videos
- ...something else probably

### Our features:

- Full ghost mode (flexible)
- Messages history (flexible)
- Message filters (e.g. hide ads)
- Customizable edited/deleted marks
- Local Telegram Premium
- Sync read states and message history with AyuSync
- Up to stream Telegram version (*snidely*)

Note that we use **Crashlytics**.
If you don't want to send crash reports, you can disable it in **exteraGram Preferences**.

**ZxcGram** does **NOT** include proprietary **exteraGram** features.

## Want to throw some money?

Developing ZxcGram is not such a simple task.
**We'd be grateful for any donation <3**

All available methods can be found **[here](https://t.me/c/3879438749/43)**.

## AyuSync? What is it?

**AyuSync** is our synchronization service.
You can either use official server or host your own.
It can sync read states and message history.

Server backend can be found **[here](none)**.

## Want to contribute?

I'd be grateful for any contribution, since I don't really like Java. :)

**Work on any feature you want.**

## Want to fork?

Well, just fork it.

**But please, don't forget to mention us in your README.**

## How to build

1. Clone source code using `git clone https://github.com/AyuGram/AyuGram4A.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio. It should be opened, **not imported**
3. Implement the `AyuMessageUtils` & `AyuHistoryHook` classes. It's not that hard, but if you're
   making your **very** own fork, then you should take some time to write this part of code. Or you can search for a reversed version :)
4. Replace `google-services.json` (we don't want to see crash reports from your app...)
5. Generate application certificate and fill API_KEYS:
   ```
   APP_ID = 6
   APP_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
   MAPS_V2_API = abcdef12345678
   
   SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD = password
   SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS = alias
   SIGNING_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD = password
   ```
6. You are ready to compile `AyuGram`

- **ZxcGram** can be built with **Android Studio** or from the command line with **Gradle**:

```
./gradlew assembleAfatRelease
```

We have our own **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ayugram)**.

But since **ZxcGram** is based on **exteraGram**, also join their project
at **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/exteralocales)**!
